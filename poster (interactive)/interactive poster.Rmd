## Value and impact

**Theoretical implication**: how does hygiene impact the virus transmission, which will help to understand the transmission dynamics of the virus. 

**Practical implication**: to evaluate the effectiveness of national hygienic cities, which will promote city hygiene in China and beyond.



## Background

 - Transmission dynamics of this emerging infectious disease haven't been fully understood 
 
 - Previous research shows the air quality may influence the virus transmission   [@li_air_2020;@iha_comparative_2016]
 
## Methods

**National hygienic city**

  - Ninety-three reconfirm national hygienic cities in China in 2018, this is the newest  list of national hygienic city. 

**Total confirmed cases**

  - nCov2019 packages
  - Excluding infected arrivals from abroad

**Move-out data before lockdown**

  - Baidu Qianxi
  - Inspect elements
  - 16 days (Jan 10,2020 - Jan 25,2020)
  - Each city's move-out strength is presented as a percentage
  - Total move-out strength was adjusted by each day's move-out strength.

## Results 

```{r include=FALSE}
require(dygraphs) 
require(xts) 
tcurve2020<-tcurve %>%filter(date2>as.Date("2020-01-01")) %>% filter(date2<as.Date("2020-03-15"))
diff(tcurve2020$date2) 
```

```{r include=FALSE}
plot1a<-tcurve2020 %>% select(V1) %>% xts(tcurve2020$date2) %>% dygraph() %>% dyOptions(fillGraph = TRUE) %>% dyRangeSelector()%>%htmlwidgets::saveWidget()

```

## Future work

 - Case-control match of hygienic cities and non-hygienic cities
 - Multiple linear regression to total confirmed cases
 - The difference in mortality & recovery time
 - Detailed hygiene condition

## Conclusions
 - Lockdown of Wuhan effectively cut-down its move-out.
 - Top 10% move-out cities from Jan are all in Hubei province
 - The national hygienic city may not have significantly better control of the epidemic
 - The outliers with weak epidemic control, are more likely to be non- national hygienic city

## Limitations

 - The transmission may start in early January, 2020 or earlier. 
 - The move-out data from Wuhan does not include transportation means
 - The real performance of local government varies in response to this emerging infectious disease
