## Conclusions
 - Lockdown of Wuhan effectively cut-down its move-out.
 - Top 10% move-out cities from Jan are all in Hubei province
 - National hygienic city may not have a significant better control of the epidemic
 - The outliers with weak epidemic control, are more likely to be non- national hygienic city


## Background

 - Transmission dynamics of this emerging infectious disease haven't been fully understanded 
 - Previous research shows the air quality may influence the disease transmission 
 
## Methods

**National hygienic city**

  - Ninety three reconfirm national hygienic cities in China in 2018, this is the newested list of national hygienic city. 

**Total confirmed cases**

  - nCov2019 packages
  - Excluding infected arrivals from abroad

**Move-out data before lockdown**

  - Baidu Qianxi
  - Inspect elements
  - 16 days (Jan 10,2020 - Jan 25,2020)
  - Each city's move-out strength is presented as percentage
  - Total move-out strength were adjusted by each day's move-out strength.

```{r out.width='100%', fig.height=6, fig4, fig.cap="A comparision of all cities outside Wuhan"}

## Future work

 - Multi-way ANOVA
 - Case-control match of cities
 - Multiple linear regression
 - Mortality & Inhospital time
 - Detailed hygiene condition

## Value and impact

**Theorical implication**: how does hygiene impact the disease transmission, which will help to understand the transimission dynamics of the virus. 

**Practical implication**: to evaluate the effectiveness of national hygienic cities, which will promote the city hygiene in China and beyond.
